A repository for all work related to HackHate2020 and project POLAR (Predicting OnLine hARm)

Project POLAR is a dashboard built to help predict online harm by monitoring the sentiment of tweets (negative/positive) over 2 specific time periods: a) 01/10/2015 - 01/10/2016 b) 01/10/2019 - 01/10/2020

TextBlob was used for the tweets sentiment classification - on the tweets, several text analyses were run i.e. links, mentions and hashtags + stemming and lemmization were run. Moreover, a wordcloud was created which highlights the most used words in the tweets collected in periods a) and b).
